# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-14)

**Core value:** Claude Code remembers what you've taught it across sessions, and teams share proven architectural knowledge through a queryable registry
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — foundation-observation

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (foundation-observation) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 3
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-04-14

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Copy-and-modify from Engram + Lens, not build from scratch
- Tool repo only (registry template bundled inside)
- Python + shell, no new language dependencies
- Worker-only registry access (no GitHub-direct)
- [Phase 01]: Preserved 'engrams' as data-format directory name and JSON key -- renaming would break data model compatibility
- [Phase 01]: Used fcntl.flock() + temp file + os.rename() + .bak backup for atomic index writes
- [Phase 01]: Settings path uses .claude/settings.local.json per D-05; PostToolUse hook uses async: True per D-08

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research flags hook performance as critical pitfall: collapse 3 Python calls to 1, cache project ID
- Research flags index.json corruption risk: need atomic writes + flock + backup
- Research flags shell injection in capture hook: pipe data through stdin to single Python process
- macOS ships Bash 3.2: avoid Bash 4+ features in hooks/installer
